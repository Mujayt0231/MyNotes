11. What is a method? What is the main method? Why do we need one in java? Do we
have to have a main method in java?

a method is function that helps us to do something, we can say it's an collection of statements that are grouped togheter to perform an operation.

Main method is where Jvm start execution of the code.

We need a main method to run our code!

Please explain the public static void main(String args[]){}

public is a access modifier
Static is keyword which makes our method become class level methods, we don't have to create an instance of the class to use that method.
main is the name of the main method, we need main method to run our code. jvm will look for main
comman line argument pass to the main method
